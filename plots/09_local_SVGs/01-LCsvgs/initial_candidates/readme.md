Beyond SVGs with potentially appreciable, LC-semi-restricted patterns, the gene plots here include those which are of either 
a) a priori interest as markers of LC;
b) a priori interest for marking another expected cell population (e.g., SLC6A4 for 5HT neurons);
c) a priori interest from (pre-) AD brainstem lit;
d) a priori interest from recent characterization of mouse peri-LC populations (Luskin..Bruchas '24 preprint)
