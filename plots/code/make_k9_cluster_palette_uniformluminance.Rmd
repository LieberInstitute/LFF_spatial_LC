## get some initial colors with cerulean as the color for LC of course
## so that expression plots in escheR where spot outlining for cluster and fill for expression do not convey false differences in dark/light across cluster colors, set luminance to a tiny range (polychrome won't let us use a single value). (and avoid black-white-gray because for the expression plotting a grayscale works best.)

pal <- Polychrome::createPalette(seedcolors = "#007ba7", N = 9,M=2500000,range = c(75:76)) # 007ba7 : cerulean. obviously; color samplespace 50x default
# colors 1,3,4,6,7,8 are fine. 2/5 are no good (orange/brown, bad for NM connotations here).
# use the first set of colors as seeds to get 20 more minimally related colors to pick from
set.seed(9009)

# peek

## alright, we want 1,4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14 here (greens for SERT ACHE, cerulean for LC, purples for oligos, red for vascular, and 2 yellows for astros (We're not getting any good yellows here with desired luminance.)
pal3 <- pal2[c(1,4,5,7,10,11,14)]
## use a manual color picker to find something luminance matched but distinctive from 21 and 7 which is sorta yellow tinged
## alright, we want 1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14 here (greens for SERT ACHE, cerulean for LC, purples for oligos, red for vascular, and 2 yellows for astros (We're not getting any good yellows here with desired luminance.)
## for our two yellows, use #e6f391 #f3df91 which are luminance matched.

# make the more blueish green ACHE..npeps since this is the cluster that had a lot of indicators of minority LC-related content and kinda trended behind LC on proportions of spots expressing various genes of interest
# make oligo_3 (the APLP1 marked one) the stark purple, since that's the real interesting oligo cluster here
