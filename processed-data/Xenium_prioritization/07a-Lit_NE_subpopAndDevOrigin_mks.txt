gene_name	notes_and_source
ASCL1 	previously CASH1 in chick and MASH1 in other spp; induced by BMP signaling in sympathetic NS development along with Phox2 genes
HAND2	previously dHand; induced by BMPs in sympathetic NS dev along with ASCL1 and PHOX2s
BMP2	Bmp2a in zebrafish; loss results in loss of LC dev
BMP5	Demonstrated to be dorsal roof plate expressed in chick r1 to specify LC (Vogel-Hopker 2002)
BMP7	Bmp7a,b in zebrafish; loss results in loss of LC dev
PAX6	in chick is expressed in dorsal and ventral rhomobomere 1, including LC-generating zone (Vogel-Hopker 2002)
PAX3	in chick, is marker of dorsal rhombomere 1 (LC-generating) neural progenitors (Vogel-Hopker 2002)
LHX2	in chick, marks interneurons initially intermingled with r1 Phox2+ neurons, but Lhx2a cells later migrate dorsal to Phox2 cells (Vogel-Hopker 2002)
HOXA2	r2-derived NE populations (Robertson Patricia Jensen 13)
EGR2	aka KROX20; r3/r5-derived NE pops (Robertson P Jensen 13)
HOXB1	Ventral subcoeruleus (Robertson P Jensen 13)
EN1	r1-derived LC-NE, dorsal subC, and A7 (Robertson P Jensen 13)
PAX7	Coexpressed with en1 during development of most but not all of subC and A7 (Plummer, P Jensen 17)
ESR1	estrogen receptor alpha (just because)
ESR2	estrogen receptor beta (doi 10.1210/en.2002-221120)
